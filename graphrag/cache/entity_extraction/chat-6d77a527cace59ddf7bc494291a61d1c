Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Through these compositions, he expressed his deep connection to his homeland and his longing for freedom. His mazurkas often feature irregular rhythms and modal harmonies, reflecting the folk music of Poland. The polonaises, especially the \"Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53\" (known as the \"Heroic\"), convey a sense of nationalism and pride, capturing the spirit of Poland's struggles and aspirations.\n\nChopin's health continued to decline in the 1840s, and his relationship with George Sand ended in 1847 under strained circumstances.

The political climate in Poland, which was under Russian control, deeply affected him. The failed November Uprising of 1830-1831, a Polish insurrection against the Russian Empire, left him feeling exiled and longing for his homeland, sentiments that frequently surfaced in his compositions. In Paris, he quickly established himself as a sought-after pianist and teacher, though he rarely performed in large public venues, preferring the intimate setting of salons. He was surrounded by a circle of friends that included prominent artists, writers, and musicians, such as Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz, and the novelist George Sand.\n\nChopin's relationship with George Sand, a well-known French writer, was one of the most significant in his life. The two became romantically involved around 1838, and their relationship lasted nearly a decade. During this period, Chopin's health, already delicate, began to deteriorate. He suffered from symptoms of what was likely tuberculosis, which plagued him for much of his life. Despite these challenges, he composed some of his most renowned works during this time, including many of his nocturnes, ballades, and mazurkas. His time spent with Sand on the island of Majorca\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
