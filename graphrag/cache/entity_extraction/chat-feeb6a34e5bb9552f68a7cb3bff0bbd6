Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Pieces like the \"Revolutionary Étude\" and \"Winter Wind Étude\" are not only studies in dexterity but also powerful expressions of emotion.\n\nThe mazurka and polonaise, traditional Polish dance forms, were central to Chopin's output. Through these compositions, he expressed his deep connection to his homeland and his longing for freedom. His mazurkas often feature irregular rhythms and modal harmonies, reflecting the folk music of Poland. The polonaises, especially the \"Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53\" (known as the \"Heroic\"), convey a sense of nationalism and pride, capturing the spirit of Poland's struggles and aspirations.\n\nChopin's health continued to decline in the 1840s, and his relationship with George Sand ended in 1847 under strained circumstances.

He traveled to England and Scotland in 1848, where he gave a series of performances, though his health severely limited his activities. He returned to Paris in 1849, where his condition worsened. Frédéric Chopin passed away on October 17, 1849, at the age of 39, likely due to complications from tuberculosis. His funeral was held at the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, and in accordance with his wishes, Mozart's \"Requiem\" was performed.\n\nChopin's legacy endures through his music, which continues to captivate audiences and inspire musicians around the world. His compositions have become fundamental to the study of piano music and are celebrated for their lyrical beauty, technical sophistication, and emotive power. The emotional depth and innovative techniques he brought to the Romantic era reshaped the landscape of piano music, influencing countless composers and performers. Beyond his musical achievements, Chopin remains a symbol of Polish cultural identity, embodying the spirit of his homeland in every note he wrote.\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
