Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in  The primary language of the provided text is English. However, it contains some French words (such as \"études\", \"Madeleine\", \"Requiem\", \"George Sand\", and \"Nocturne\") that are commonly used in English contexts but are originally from French. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into  The primary language of the provided text is English. However, it contains some French words (such as \"études\", \"Madeleine\", \"Requiem\", \"George Sand\", and \"Nocturne\") that are commonly used in English contexts but are originally from French., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5.

Pieces like the \"Revolutionary Étude\" and \"Winter Wind Étude\" are not only studies in dexterity but also powerful expressions of emotion.\n\nThe mazurka and polonaise, traditional Polish dance forms, were central to Chopin's output. Through these compositions, he expressed his deep connection to his homeland and his longing for freedom. His mazurkas often feature irregular rhythms and modal harmonies, reflecting the folk music of Poland. The polonaises, especially the \"Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53\" (known as the \"Heroic\"), convey a sense of nationalism and pride, capturing the spirit of Poland's struggles and aspirations.\n\nChopin's health continued to decline in the 1840s, and his relationship with George Sand ended in 1847 under strained circumstances.
